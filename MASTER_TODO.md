# WSA PacMan — Master TODO

**Last updated:** 2026-11-04  
**Project repository:** https://github.com/eboxont-code/wsa_pacman_x  
**Active implementation PR:** https://github.com/eboxont-code/wsa_pacman_x/pull/12

## Working rules

1. **Start every job here:** read this file, identify the next single task, and mark only that task as `🔄 WORKING` before changing code or project files.
2. **One job at a time:** do not start another task until the current task is completed, verified, and recorded here.
3. **End every job here:** record what changed, what was tested, the result, and any remaining blocker. Mark a task `✅ DONE` only when there is evidence; otherwise leave it `⏳ WAITING` or `❌ BLOCKED`.
4. Keep the **Current task** section accurate throughout the job. Never leave a completed task marked as working.
5. Preserve this file across branches and releases. When working on a PR branch, update this file on that branch so the progress is committed with the work.
6. Do not claim runtime behaviour is verified just because the code compiles or CI passes.

## Status key

- ✅ **DONE** — completed and verified
- 🔄 **WORKING** — the one task currently being worked on
- ⏳ **WAITING** — waiting for a user test, decision, dependency, or external action
- ⬜ **NOT STARTED** — not yet begun
- ❌ **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; reason must be recorded
- ❌ **FAILED** — a test was performed and the expected behaviour did not occur

## Current task

- 🔄 **Diagnose missing per-app tray icons** — the user's real-device test shows the WSA/PacMan icon, but no Android app icons. Find why app windows are not registering with the per-app tray hook.

## Project goal

Every Android app window running under WSA must behave independently in the Windows notification area:

- Closing an app window hides only that app window; it must not close the Android activity or other apps.
- Each hidden app has its own tray icon, using the app's own identity where available.
- Clicking one app's tray icon restores only that app.
- Other Android apps remain unaffected.
- YouTube Music (and other apps) should continue background activity/audio while hidden.
- WSA PacMan's own controls and tray behaviour remain separate from individual Android app windows.

## Master checklist

### 1. Requirements and design

- ✅ Confirm independent per-app behaviour is the requirement.
- ✅ Keep WSA PacMan's own tray behaviour separate from per-app tray icons.
- ✅ Require the hidden app/activity to remain running; background playback must be tested.
- ✅ Require each app's tray icon to restore only its own window.

### 2. Implementation — PR #12

- ✅ Add per-app tray hook implementation.
- ✅ Add individual app-window hide and restore handling.
- ✅ Remove the previous workspace-wide hide/restore approach from this implementation.
- ✅ Add the hook DLL to the Windows build/package.
- ✅ Add CI regression checks for the hook and package contents.
- ❌ FAILED in observed runtime test: WSA/PacMan is visible in the tray, but Android app tray icons are not appearing. Hook attachment/registration is not yet proven.

### 3. Build and packaging

- ✅ Windows CI build completed for PR #12.
- ✅ CI workflow run #133 passed for PR head `7990601beee46e9ca8e8b56710903dde0d7452fb`.
- ✅ Portable package produced and inspected.
- ✅ Windows installer produced and inspected.
- ✅ Test installer supplied to the user.

### 4. Real-device validation

- ✅ User installed and launched the PR #12 test build; the WSA/PacMan icon is visible in the Windows notification overflow.
- ❌ Android app tray icons do not appear in the user's test; this is the current failure to diagnose.
- ⬜ Re-test after the hook-registration issue is fixed.
- ⬜ Open YouTube and YouTube Music together and capture diagnostic output for both WsaClient windows.
- ⬜ Click YouTube's X — only YouTube hides.
- ⬜ Confirm YouTube has its own notification-area tray icon (including under the `^` overflow if Windows places it there).
- ⬜ Click YouTube's tray icon — only YouTube restores.
- ⬜ Confirm YouTube Music continues playing while YouTube is hidden.
- ⬜ Repeat the hide/restore test with WhatsApp.
- ⬜ Test multiple Android apps hidden at the same time; confirm each icon restores the correct app.
- ⬜ Check minimize/restore interactions.
- ⬜ Exit WSA PacMan and confirm no app window is left unintentionally hidden.
- ⬜ Check for crashes, duplicate/stale tray icons, or stuck windows.

### 5. Fix, retest, and release

- ⬜ Diagnose and fix any real-device test failures.
- ⬜ Rebuild and rerun CI after code changes.
- ⬜ Repeat every relevant real-device test after fixes.
- ⬜ Confirm the final tested commit and package contents.
- ⬜ Merge PR #12 only after the required runtime tests pass.
- ⬜ Build the final release from the merged `main` branch.
- ⬜ Verify the final installer and portable package.
- ⬜ Publish final download links and SHA-256 checksums.
- ⬜ Record the released version, commit, build run, and known limitations.

## Current verified facts

- PR #12 is open and targets `main`.
- PR branch: `wsa/per-app-tray-icons`.
- PR head at checklist creation: `7990601beee46e9ca8e8b56710903dde0d7452fb`.
- Latest known CI run: [#133](https://github.com/eboxont-code/wsa_pacman_x/actions/runs/41821575957), successful.
- CI success confirms build/package validation; **it does not prove runtime behaviour on the user's WSA installation**.
- The supplied test installer is for validation only. PR #12 has not been merged.

## Work log

### 2026-11-04
- ✅ Created this persistent master checklist on the PR #12 branch.
- ✅ Confirmed PR #12 is open and the checklist did not previously exist on that branch.
- ❌ User's first real-device test: the WSA/PacMan tray icon appears, but no per-app Android icons appear.
- 🔄 Current job: diagnose why the per-app hook is not discovering/hooking Android app windows or adding their icons.
